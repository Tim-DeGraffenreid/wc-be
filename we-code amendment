Notes from today's design (for Friday)
Processes

Student first signs up for wecode and has an account/parent account.

Then the student will be able to pick 1 class for any given saturday and register for it.

On the day of the class, the student should bring the QR code to Wecode.

Wecode will hold a decoder app on a laptop or ipad style device (which secures the signin)

When the qr code is scanned, a page should launch, confirming that the person scanning's data is correct. When confirming the scan, an api is called to store these items in the database.

Table required: student_checkin

fields:

personID / studentId/ userID (name should match the student table)

class_name

checkin_date (formatted)

checkout_date (formatted)

To-do:

Gram has python to generate a QR code today. Can this be converted to javascript? May need to find substitutable libraries to allow this

Create the decoder app and make it available to whoever sits at the front desk of wecode. Store on the web somewhere so that anyone within wecode can access?

Questions to answer:

What if a student loses his/her qr code?

The account should have an email/phone number. It can be emailed to the student as needed.

How do we ensure that the student attended and did infact scan in and attend?

Only wecode staff will have the appropriate decoder to allow the checkin to save.

When the student registers, how do we know what date and class is associated to the qr code?

This is part of the label

What happens if a student forgets to sign in or out?

When validating the qr code, perhaps allow the date field to be modified before it is confirmed.
